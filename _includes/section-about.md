I am recent PhD graduate from [School of Computing Science](http://cs.sfu.ca) at [Simon Fraser University](http://www.sfu.ca), where I was a member of [Autonomy Lab](http://autonomylab.org). My main area of PhD research was vision mediated human-<abbr title="Unmanned Aerial Vehicle">UAV</abbr> interaction. Besides, I am interested in developing tools and techniques that make robotic experiments robust and more fun. I am a passionate roboticist and software developer, a [free software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) enthusiastic, a former [Robocuper](#robocupssl) and a big fan of [Die Mannschaft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team).
